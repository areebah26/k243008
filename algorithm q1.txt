implement an algorithm for determining if Nth is a divisor of n number. If so determine if it is even or odd.

Ask the user to enter the number "n"
Ask the user to enter the divsior "N"

if n % N = 0
  print " N is a divisor of n "
  if n % 2 = 0
     print " N is even "
  else 
     print" N is odd"

else 
  print " N is not a divisor of n "

if N = 0
   print " syntax error"
