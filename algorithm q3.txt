implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators

ask the user a number " k "
ask the user a second number " l "
ask the user an operator

SET sum to 0

if the operator is "+ "
  print" k+l "
else if the operator is "- "
  print" k-l"
else if the operator is "* "
  print" k*l "
else if l = 0 and the operator is " /"
  print" mathematical error"
   else print" k/l "
else if the operator is "% "
  print" k%l "
  
else 
  print" syntax error "
